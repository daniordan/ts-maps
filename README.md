App randomly generates two different entities: User and Company with random data: first name, last name, age, name of the company, phone, address, etc. Every User in every Company will have a location property tied to it as well (longitude and latitude). It will generate location to show it on Google map inside the browser for User and Company, using GoogleApis.
